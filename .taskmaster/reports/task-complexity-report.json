			"taskId": 21,
			"taskTitle": "Research and Implement Compliant Payment Integration",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Research and Implement Compliant Payment Integration' task into detailed subtasks, covering legal research, provider selection, UI/UX design, removal of Polar.sh, integration of the new provider's SDK, refactoring of the `usePayment` hook and `PaymentModal` component, updating UI terminology, and comprehensive testing in a sandbox environment.",
			"reasoning": "This task is highly complex due to its multi-faceted nature. It involves significant external research (legal and provider evaluation), a complete replacement of a core third-party integration (Polar.sh), and extensive refactoring of existing payment logic (`usePayment` hook, `PaymentModal` component). The UI/UX needs to be redesigned with compliant terminology, and robust error/success handling for the new provider must be implemented. This is essentially a greenfield integration within an existing structure, impacting critical user flows and requiring careful consideration of German legal requirements. The dependencies on Task 18 (which it replaces) and Task 23 (which will use the new payment flow) add to its criticality."

			"taskId": 22,
			"taskTitle": "Remove ELSTER Export File Functionality",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail the subtasks for 'Remove ELSTER Export File Functionality', including removing UI buttons from `ReportDisplay.tsx`, deleting `exportHelper.ts`, cleaning up associated event handlers and imports, and verifying no orphaned payment triggers remain.",
			"reasoning": "This is a relatively low-complexity task. It primarily involves removing existing UI elements (buttons) and deleting a dedicated utility file (`exportHelper.ts`). The main effort is ensuring all references and event handlers are properly cleaned up in `src/components/ReportDisplay.tsx` and that no unintended side effects occur, especially concerning the payment triggers which were previously linked to these export buttons."

		{
			"taskId": 23,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Gated Access to ELSTER View via Payment Modal",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Outline the subtasks for 'Implement Gated Access to ELSTER View via Payment Modal', focusing on modifying `ReportDisplay.tsx` to add a new button, implementing state management for ELSTER access, connecting the button to the payment modal (via the `usePayment` hook), handling modal success/skip callbacks, and conditionally rendering the ELSTER report component.",
			"reasoning": "This task has moderate complexity. It requires modifying an existing component (`ReportDisplay.tsx`) to introduce new UI elements and conditional rendering logic. Implementing state management (`isElsterAccessGranted`) and integrating with the existing `usePayment` hook (which will be updated by Task 21) for triggering the payment modal and handling its outcomes are key parts. While the task description mentions Polar.sh, the actual implementation will likely leverage the new payment integration from Task 21, assuming the `usePayment` hook maintains a consistent interface. This dependency adds a slight layer of coordination."

			"taskId": 24,
			"taskTitle": "Redesign Landing Page Proof Section for Simplicity and Accessibility",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail the subtasks for 'Redesign Landing Page Proof Section for Simplicity and Accessibility', including identifying the target component, removing card-specific styling and background, refactoring the HTML structure to a list format, ensuring visual separation, and reviewing content for simplicity.",
			"reasoning": "This is a straightforward UI/UX refactoring task. It involves modifying existing CSS properties (removing shadows, borders, backgrounds) and updating the HTML structure from a card-based layout to a simpler list (`<ul>`/`<li>`). The primary challenge is ensuring responsiveness and accessibility are maintained or improved, but the changes are contained within a specific component and its styles."

		{
			"taskId": 25,
			"taskTitle": "Left-Align Report View Rows",
			"complexityScore": 1,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Left-Align Report View Rows' task into subtasks, focusing on locating the relevant CSS rule in `ReportDisplay.tsx`, applying `text-align: left;` or `justify-content: flex-start;`, and verifying consistency and responsiveness across the report view.",
			"reasoning": "This is a very low-complexity task. It involves a simple CSS modification to change text alignment within the `ReportDisplay.tsx` component. The main effort is identifying the correct CSS rule and ensuring the change is applied consistently without negatively impacting the layout on different screen sizes."
