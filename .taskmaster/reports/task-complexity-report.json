			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Integrate Components for End-to-End Flow'. The goal is to create the main data processing pipeline. Create subtasks for: 1. Creating an event handler for the file upload component that receives the file. 2. Implementing a primary 'orchestration' function that sequentially calls the parser, categorization engine, and calculation engine. 3. Integrating this pipeline with the application's state management to handle loading states and store the final `EuerReport` object. 4. Implementing the UI loading indicator that is displayed during the processing.",
			"reasoning": "Complexity is rated 7/10 as this task is the central integration point for multiple complex, independent modules (UI, parser, two engines). It involves managing an asynchronous data pipeline, orchestrating function calls, and handling application state (loading, final data, potential errors), which is a critical and moderately complex architectural challenge. Breaking it into 4 subtasks follows the logical data flow: capturing input, processing through the pipeline, managing state, and providing user feedback, making the implementation more structured and manageable."
