# Task ID: 9
# Title: Refine UI/UX and Handle Error States
# Status: todo
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Polish the user interface and implement robust handling for potential user errors and edge cases.
# Details:
Implement user-friendly error messages for invalid file types (non-CSV), corrupted files, or parsing failures. Add a small info section explaining the client-side privacy model. Ensure the entire experience is intuitive for the non-accountant user persona.

# Test Strategy:
Manual testing of error paths: upload a .txt file, a corrupted CSV, or a CSV from an unsupported bank. Ensure clear, helpful feedback is provided to the user.
