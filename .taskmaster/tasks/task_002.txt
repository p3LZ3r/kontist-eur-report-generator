# Task ID: 2
# Title: Build Static UI Components for Upload and Report Display
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the static, non-functional React components for the main application interface based on the specified user flow.
# Details:
Implement a single-page layout as per the 'UI/UX Considerations'. Create a file input component with a clear call-to-action for CSV upload. Build a placeholder report display component with static labels matching the official EÃœR form terminology.

# Test Strategy:
Visual verification of components in the app or a tool like Storybook. Ensure the layout is clean, minimal, and follows the single-page design principle.
