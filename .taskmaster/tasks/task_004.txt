# Task ID: 4
# Title: Develop SKR Categorization Engine
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the core engine to automatically assign an official SKR accounting category to each transaction.
# Details:
Build a function that takes a `NormalizedTransaction` and a ruleset. The engine will use keyword and pattern matching on the transaction description to map it to an SKR03/SKR04 category. The ruleset will be loaded from a JSON file as specified in the Appendix.

# Test Strategy:
Write extensive unit tests. For a given transaction description and ruleset, assert that the correct SKR category is returned. Test edge cases and transactions that should remain uncategorized.
