# Task ID: 7
# Title: Populate Report Display with Calculated Data
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Dynamically render the calculated EÜR report in the UI, making it ready for the user to transcribe to ELSTER.
# Details:
Modify the report display component (Task 2) to consume the `EuerReport` data from the application state. Display the key calculated values with labels and line numbers that directly correspond to the official EÜR form, as specified in 'ELSTER-mapped Report Display'.

# Test Strategy:
Visual and functional testing. Upload a test CSV and verify that the numbers displayed in the UI match the expected calculated totals. Cross-reference the UI labels with the official EÜR form.
