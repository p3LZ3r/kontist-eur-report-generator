# Title: Initialize SPA Project with Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the foundational client-side project structure for the EÃœR Report Generator Single-Page Application (SPA).
# Details:
Use Vite to scaffold a new React project. Integrate Tailwind CSS for styling as per the 'Logical Dependency Chain' foundation step. Establish the basic folder structure for components, logic (engines), and data models (`RawTransaction`, `NormalizedTransaction`, `EuerReport`).

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the development server runs successfully and that a basic component with Tailwind CSS classes renders correctly in the browser.
