# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement CSV Parser and Data Normalization Logic
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the client-side logic to parse uploaded CSV files from Kontist and Holvi and transform them into a standardized internal format.
# Details:
Use a client-side parsing library. Implement distinct adapters for Kontist and Holvi formats to handle potential future changes. The parser must identify the source bank and convert each row into the `NormalizedTransaction` data model.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test the parsing and normalization logic with sample Kontist and Holvi CSV files. Assert that the output array of `NormalizedTransaction` objects is correct for both formats.
